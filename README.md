# Final-Project
Apart from the scene modelling and robot models, which utilised existing assets, all other components were entirely developed by our team.
We have implemented the robot positioning and orientation acquisition module, the trajectory recording conversion to binary map module, the GPS path conversion to waypoint module, and the path tracking controller.
